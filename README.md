# 🌍 BSM-2D: Boussinesq–Soil Moisture 2D Hydrologic Model

**BSM-2D** is a two-dimensional, physically based hydrologic model that solves the transient Boussinesq equation for unconfined groundwater flow. It is coupled with an explicit unsaturated zone (UZ) reservoir model to represent vertical moisture dynamics. This framework provides a computationally efficient alternative to full Richards Equation simulations at the hillslope scale while preserving physical interpretability.

This model was built upon the model presented in 

Brandhorst, N., Erdal, D. and Neuweiler, I., 2021. Coupling saturated and unsaturated flow: comparing the iterative and the non-iterative approach. Hydrology and Earth System Sciences, 25(7), pp.4041-4059.

## 🧠 Model Rationale

At intermediate scales (10–100 m), fully solving the Richards equation in 3D is computationally expensive and often poorly constrained by field data. BSM-2D addresses this by:

- Modeling lateral saturated flow via the **2D Boussinesq equation**
- Representing vertical unsaturated dynamics via a **linear reservoir approximation**
- Supporting **state- and parameter-dependent closure relationships** such as variable specific yield
- Enabling **data assimilation** using particle filters (optional)

- Hillslope-scale hydrology
- Seepage discharge modeling
- Coupled vadose–phreatic systems
- Data assimilation with sensor observations
- Conceptual catchment testing

## 📄 Governing Equations

### 1. Transient 2D Boussinesq Equation

<div align="center">

$$
\frac{\partial}{\partial x} \left( K_x h \frac{\partial h}{\partial x} \right) +
\frac{\partial}{\partial y} \left( K_y h \frac{\partial h}{\partial y} \right) +
N^*(x, y, t) = S_y(x, y, t) \frac{\partial h}{\partial t}
$$

</div>

**Where:**
- `h(x, y, t)`: water table elevation [L]  
- `K_x, K_y`: saturated hydraulic conductivity [L/T]  
- `N^*(x, y, t)`: recharge rate from UZ [L/T]  
- `S_y(x, y, t)`: specific yield [–]

### 2. Specific Yield (van Genuchten-based)

<div align="center">

$$
S_y(h) = (\theta_s - \theta_r) \left[1 - \left(1 + \left(\alpha(h - y)\right)^n \right)^{- \frac{n+1}{n}} \right]
$$

</div>

**Where:**
- `θ_s, θ_r`: saturated and residual moisture content [–]  
- `α, n`: van Genuchten parameters [1/L], [–]  
- `y`: bedrock elevation [L]

### 3. Unsaturated Zone Linear Reservoir

<div align="center">

$$
\frac{dS_{UZ}}{dt} = I^* - N^* \quad ; \quad N^* = k \cdot S_{UZ}
$$

</div>

Discretized as:

<div align="center">

$$
S_{UZ}^{t+\Delta t} = S_{UZ}^t + \Delta t \cdot (I^t - k \cdot S_{UZ}^t)
$$

</div>

**Where:**
- `S_{UZ}`: unsaturated zone storage [L]  
- `I`: input irrigation or rainfall [L/T]  
- `k`: drainage/recession coefficient [1/T]
